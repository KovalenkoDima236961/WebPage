    "comment3" => "The best price-quality ratio in the Apple lineup, as of January 2021! Smartphone
    performance! The battery is great, it lasts very long. The design is perhaps the best of
    all iPhones! It's a pleasure to hold in your hands. It does not feel large, comfortable. The
    quality of the photos pleases. So: - for a man's hand - wide and comfortable to hold,
    heavy - ips screen with a more than sufficient resolution, without acid colors and glare, -
    the charge is enough for two days, - face unlocking works quickly and accurately, -
    excellent sound, as I use it , as well as in headphones, there are no problems with
    performance, since nothing slows down, it withstands any load. The phone is cool. The
    charge lasts from early morning to evening with almost non-stop use. The phone just
    flies. Face ID works instantly, in the dark or in bright sunlight - it doesn't matter.",
    "comment4" => "If you're looking for a cheaper iPhone, but don't want to sacrifice performance or
    features, the iPhone XR is the best option. In terms of performance, it is quite
    comparable to the iPhone 8, but it has a much larger, brighter display, and its cameras
    are better. It's not as good as the iPhone XS, but it's much more affordable - and that's
    a trade-off worth considering.",
