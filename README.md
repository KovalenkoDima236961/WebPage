<h1>University Project on Phone Selling Web Page</h1>
<p>Welcome to the documentation for my university project, which aimed at creating a web page for selling phones. This project leverages a range of technologies including PHP, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL to provide a comprehensive and interactive user experience.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The main goal of this project was to develop a fully functional webpage where users can review the phone (its characteristics, how it records video, takes photos, and compares it to another phone). And read or write a review themselves</p>

        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Developed using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Implemented with PHP to handle server-side logic and dynamic content.</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL used to store user comments and other dynamic data.</li>
